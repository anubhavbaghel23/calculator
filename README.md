Calculator Project

In this project i have created a calculator which works exactly like how a calculator should work.

This is my last project from the foundation course of 'theOdinProject'.

1# Enter desired value using buttons
2# Press the operator button
3# Enter another desired value
4# Either continue the calculation using another operator Or
5# End this calculation and get result using equals button

** User Can clear all the values using AC button
** Or the user can just delete the last digit of the displayed value using DEL button.
